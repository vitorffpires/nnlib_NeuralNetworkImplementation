# Neural Network Library using Numpy
This project offers a lightweight and intuitive neural network library built exclusively with Python's numpy and mathematical libraries. It's designed for those who want to understand the underlying mechanics of neural networks without the overhead of larger frameworks.

# Overview
The library provides the essential building blocks to create, train, and evaluate neural network models. It's modular, allowing users to mix and match components as needed.

# Features
Activation Functions: Supports various activation functions

Initialization Functions: Methods to initialize weights for the neural network layers.

Layers: Define the architecture of the neural network.

Loss Functions: Compute the error between the predicted and actual values.

Optimization Functions: Algorithms to adjust the weights based on the computed loss.

Models: Define and manage the neural network model.
